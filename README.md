# About seedTools
*seedTools* is an R package offering a collection of functions designed to simplify seed biology-related tasks. It aims to be an ever-expanding repository of tools—a "function bazaar"—where users can contribute and share functions that streamline common workflows such as media calculations, data analysis, and visualization. Whether you're looking to accelerate your own seed biology tasks or provide tools to benefit the wider community, *seedTools* is here to help.

#How to Cite seedTools
As *seedTools* evolves, incorporating contributions from multiple authors, maintaining a stable citation for the package as a whole can become challenging. Publishing the package in a static format may not adequately recognize future contributors and updates.

Instead, the recommended approach is to cite individual functions directly in your work. For example:

"*We used the `rh_mix()` function from the seedTools package (https://github.com/pgomba/seedTools).*"

In your bibliography, reference the package as:

*seedTools* (version).Go-To toolbox for seed siology in R. Retrieved from https://github.com/pgomba/seedTools.
